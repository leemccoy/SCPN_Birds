The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program was designed to determine the current status and monitor long-term trends in the condition of park natural resources, providing park managers with a strong sci-entific foundation for making decisions and working with other agencies and the public for the protection of park ecosystems. The goal of bird community monitoring is to provide status and trends data on bird communities in several predominant habitats where integrated upland or riparian vegetation monitoring is also occurring.
For `r tempreport$ParkName` (`r tempreport$Park`), Southern Colorado Plateau Network (SCPN) and monument staff selected the `r tempreport$Habitat` ecological site as an important ecosystem for vegetation and bird community monitoring. 
In this report, we document monitoring activities of the `r tempreport$EventYear` field season and summarize the data that were collected.
